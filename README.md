# SENG 513 - Winter 2020 - Final Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

- Install NodeJS v12 from https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/
- Clone the repo
- Run `npm ci` to install all the dependencies
- Run `npm start` to start the application locally
- Application will start on `https://localhost:3000`

### IDE Integration

1. WebStorm: https://prettier.io/docs/en/webstorm.html
2. VSCode: Install the `eslint` and `prettier` plugins. Add these configurations to your settings
   ```
   "editor.formatOnSave": true,
   "eslint.format.enable": true,
   "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
       "source.fixAll.eslint": true
   },
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Code Style

This project uses [eslint](https://eslint.org) and [prettier](https://prettier.io) for linting and formatting JavaScript code. <br>
For CSS/SCSS style, we use [stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint) and [scss](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax). <br>

By default, all the linters run in pre-commit hooks to ensure that code is following the expected style guidelines <br>
before it is committed.

The following scripts are included: <br>

- `npm run lint`: Runs the linting tools and outputs and violations to the console
- `npm run lint:fix`: Same as above, but will attempt to fix any violations. Note <br>
  that eslint cannot fix some errors. Any errors that are not fixed will be displayed <br>
  in the console.
